# C Recap Workshop

A quick review of basic C concepts. See <a href="https://github.com/hcgatewood/c-caesar-solution">here</a> for solutions and the decoded message.


## Caesar cipher
Today we'll be implementing a very simple Caesar cipher in `caesar.c`. A Caesar cipher is a simple encryption technique. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher">here</a> for how it works.

A few notes:

- The encoded message and your alphabet are included in `caesar.c`
- Print every possible shift/rotation--since there are 26 letters in your alphabet, there will be 26 possible shifts
- One of these shifts will be readable--if so, you're done!
